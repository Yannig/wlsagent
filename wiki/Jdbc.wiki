#summary This page details the jdbc option usage

=== jdbc option ===

The jdbc option allows you to monitor the !WebLogic server JDBC datasources usage.

When sending a request to the plugin, you have to do something like this :

`jdbc=ds1;2;4|ds2;2;4&<some other parameter(s)>`

ds1 and ds2 would be your datasource names, and '2' and '4' would be 'warning' and 'critical' thresholds for both of them.

With the above example, you will get this kind of output:

`jdbc-ds1-capacity=1 jdbc-ds1-active=0 jdbc-ds1-waiting=0 jdbc-ds2-capacity=8 jdbc-ds2-active=2 jdbc-ds2-waiting=0`

The capacity value is the current jdbc pool size at the time the test is performed. The active value is the number of active JDBC connections for the monitored datasource, and the waiting value correspond to the number of threads waiting for a connection from the pool.

When using this option, you can specify 'warning' and 'critical' thresholds values. The comparison is made beetween the thresholds and the 'waiting' value. So for the ds2 datasource, a warning alert will be raised if 10 or 11 active connections are required by the application, and a critical alert will be raised for 12 active connections required or more.  

Messages look like this:

`1|server1: status WARNING - Warning alert raised by the jdbc test |`

`2|server1: status CRITICAL - Critical alert raised by the jdbc test |`
