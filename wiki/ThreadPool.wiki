#summary This page details the thread-pool option usage

=== thread-pool option ===

  * Invocation

{{{
thread-pool=ThreadActiveCount;w;c
}}}

In this generic example, 'w' and 'c' are warning and critical values. The !ThreadActiveCount / !ThreadPoolSize ratio will be compared to these values.

  * Output

{{{
ThreadPoolSize=16 ThreadActiveCount=5;;;0;16 Throughput=14.31
}}}

The !ThreadPoolSize value is the total number of threads in the pool. The !ThreadActiveCount value is the active thread count at the time the test is performed. The minimal value is always 0, and the max value is the !ThreadPoolSize value (i.e. '!ExecuteThreadTotalCount' attribute of the ThreadPoolRuntimeMBean). The Throughput value is the mean number of requests completed per second.
