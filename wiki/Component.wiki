  * Invocation

{{{
component=<app 1>;w;c|<app 2>;w;c|...|<app N>;w;c
}}}

Notice that 'app1' and 'app2' must be the exact context root of your application. The numbers that follow the context root are 'warning' and 'critical' threshold values. Fir each web application, the current active HTTP session count is compared to the specified thresholds.

  * Output

With the above example, you will get this kind of output:

{{{
app1=89 app2=128
}}}

The output gives the current active HTTP session count for each application specified by the user.
