#summary This page details the component option usage

=== component option ===

  * Invocation

{{{
component=<app 1>;w;c|<app 2>;w;c|...|<app N>;w;c
}}}

Notice that 'app1' and 'app2' must be the exact context root of your application. The numbers that follow the context root are 'warning' and 'critical' threshold values. For each web application, the current active HTTP session count is compared to the specified thresholds.

You can also call the component test with a wildcard:

{{{
component=*;100;150
}}}

Notice the 'warning' and 'critical' thresholds will be the same for all applications though.

  * Output

With the above example, you will get this kind of output:

{{{
app1=89 app2=128
}}}

The output gives the current active HTTP session count for each application specified by the user. If you're using a wildcard, WebLogic internal components won't appear in the application list.
