#summary This page details the component option usage

=== component option ===

The component option allows you to monitor the active HTTP sessions count for any web module.

You can use this option this way:

`component=app1;100;120|app2;200;250&<some other parameter(s)>`

Notice that 'app1' and 'app2' must be the exact context root of your application. The numbers that follow the context root are 'warning' and 'critical' threshold values.

With the above example, you will get this kind of output:

`app1=89 app2=128`

When using this option, you can specify 'warning' and 'critical' threshold values. The comparison is made beetween the thresholds and the active sessions count.

Messages look like this:

`1|server1: status WARNING - Warning alert raised by the component test |`

`2|server1: status CRITICAL - Critical alert raised by the component test |`
